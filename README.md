# allies_llmt_data
Data for the ALLIES Lifelong Learning Machine Translation evaluation campaign

# Description
This dataset contains the documents from Europarl v10 and NewsCommentary v15.
Each document has been renamed to the following format:
<corpus>-<date>-<time1>-<time2>-<suffix>

<corpus> is either 'ep' for Europarl or 'nc' for NewsCommentary.
<date> is the document date in the formnat YYYYMMDD.
<time1> and <time2> (both optional) are integer values making sure that each document has a unique <date>-<time1>-<time2>.
<suffix> is the remaining of the originial document name.

For Europarl, the renaming simply consists in merging year, month and day values from original name and add a '<time1>' tag to avoid multiple files with same timestamps.
For NewsCommentary, the timestamps correspond to the 'article:published_time' extracted from the original html files.
